## Exercise I

      a) O(n³)


      b) O(n²)


      c) O(1)

## Exercise II

      # starting at the ground.
      #
      # (begin)
      #   travel up by one floor.
      #   drop egg.
      #   return floor number if the egg broke
      #   return "unbreakable" if we've reach the top floor
      # (loop)
      #
      #     *run-time-complexity is O(n)
